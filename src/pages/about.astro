	<p>
		I am a Software Engineer with over 3 years of experience specializing in CI/CD and build automation. My expertise lies in architecting and configuring end-to-end pipelines for mobile platforms, including Android, iOS, and Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM). I have extensive experience integrating tools like Fastlane and Appetize into release workflows to streamline development.
	</p>

	<p>
		Beyond mobile, I have extended CI systems to game development, automating builds and deployments for Unity projects to Steam. I combine hands-on pipeline engineering with a developer-first approach to ensure smooth and reliable software delivery.
