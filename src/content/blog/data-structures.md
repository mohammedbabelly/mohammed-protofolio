When I started coding, I wasn't obsessed with data structures and algorithms (DSA). I learned by building things – small apps, scripts, then real projects. DSA came later, naturally, when I needed it.

Today, many beginners dive straight into LeetCode, grinding 500+ problems before writing their first useful program. Is that the best path?

From my experience (and conversations with hundreds of devs):

**Pros of early DSA focus**  
- Builds strong problem-solving fundamentals  
- Great for interviews at big tech

**Cons**  
- Can cause burnout and frustration  
- Delays real-world skills (debugging, APIs, deployment, teamwork)  
- Many never build anything “real”

My advice to beginners in 2026:  
1. Build first – make something you care about (game, tool, app)  
2. Learn DSA as you hit walls  
3. Balance theory with practice

What do you think? Were you DSA-obsessed early on, or did you take the builder route?
