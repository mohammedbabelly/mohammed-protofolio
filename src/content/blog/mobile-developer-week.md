What a week! Abu Dhabi's **Mobile Developers Week** brought together **Google DevFest**, **droidcon**, **Swift Heroes**, and **GovAI Summit** under one roof — and I had the chance to speak, network, and meet incredible developers from around the world.

### Before the Event: Big Announcement
GDG Dubai announced they were hosting their annual **DevFest** as part of Mobile Developers Week this December. Sessions covered everything: AI, Android, iOS, Cloud, DevOps — pure fire 🔥

I was thrilled to be selected for **two sessions** focused on Flutter:
- **White-labeling Flutter Apps** – How to efficiently manage multi-brand deployments with CI/CD
- **Over-the-Air Updates for Flutter** – Using tools like Shorebird + Codemagic for seamless, fast updates without app store resubmissions

### The Experience
The energy was unreal — packed rooms, deep technical discussions, and great conversations with talented folks from different corners of the globe. Presenting to a live audience about real-world Flutter automation felt rewarding, especially seeing people take notes and ask thoughtful questions afterward.

Huge thanks to the organizers, attendees, and everyone who stopped by my sessions. Events like this remind me why I love sharing knowledge in the community.

If you missed it, the recordings/slides might pop up soon — or reach out if you'd like a quick rundown of the tips!

See you at the next one 👋
