Big announcement: My new online course **Introduction to Cloud Computing** (مقدمة عن الحوسبة السحابية) is now available on **almentor** – the leading platform for high-quality Arabic learning content!

I collaborated with almentor to create this course as a perfect starting point for anyone curious about the cloud. Whether you're a developer, student, or professional looking to upskill, this will give you a solid foundation without overwhelming jargon.

### Course Highlights
- **Duration**: 53 minutes across **11 concise lessons**
- **Language**: Arabic (fully accessible for Arabic-speaking learners)
- **Level**: General / Beginner – no prior requirements, just interest in the topic!
- **Key Topics Covered**:
  - What is cloud computing and why it's transforming tech?
  - Service models: SaaS, PaaS, IaaS
  - Deployment models: Public, Private, Hybrid clouds
  - Virtual machines – how they optimize resources
  - Choosing the right provider (AWS, Azure, GCP)
  - Planning your cloud migration: Economic, security, and compliance considerations
  - Migration strategies, advantages, challenges, and how to overcome them
  - Emerging trends in cloud tech (future innovations)

The course includes a **free lesson** ("What is Cloud Computing?") so you can preview it right away.

### Why I Created This
Cloud computing powers almost everything we use today – from apps to AI – but many people still feel it's too complex to start. I wanted to break it down simply, in Arabic, so more developers in our region can jump in confidently. It's short, practical, and focused on real-world understanding.

### How to Get Started
Enroll now (or start with the free lesson):  
https://app.almentor.net/courses/Introduction-to-Cloud-Computing (or search "Introduction to Cloud Computing" on almentor.net)

Full access is part of almentor's subscription (~$11/month for all courses). Upon completion, you'll get a certificate too!

This is just the beginning – more advanced courses on cloud, automation, and dev tools are in the works. If you've taken it or plan to, I'd love to hear your thoughts!
